# Wheelwriter-USB-Firmware
Keyboard firmware for Arduino (Teensy LC) to have a wheelwriter keyboard connect to a computer via USB

This uses the colemak layout. It should be a small modification to make it QWERT.

The rows should be connected to pins 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.
The columns should be connected to pins 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
